## Project Overview

### Business Problem
Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL) needed a centralized system to manage Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMC) and Purchase Orders across multiple departments. The existing manual process led to:
- Missed contract renewals
- Lack of visibility into contract status
- Manual tracking prone to errors
- No automated reminders for expiring contracts
- Difficulty in managing multi-department assets

### Solution
A comprehensive web-based AMC Management System that provides:
- Centralized contract and purchase order management
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Owner)
- Automated email notifications for expiring contracts
- Real-time dashboard with key metrics
- Department-wise segregation of data
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop access

### Project Scope
- **Duration**: 3 months
- **Team Size**: 1 Full-stack Developer
- **Target Users**: 50+ employees across 7 departments
- **Expected Load**: 1000+ contracts and purchase orders

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - User submits credentials
   - Server validates and returns JWT
   - Client stores token and includes in requests
   - Middleware validates token on protected routes

2. **Contract Management Flow**
   - User creates/updates contract
   - Server validates data and permissions
   - Database stores contract with owner relationship
   - Email notifications scheduled if needed

3. **Notification Flow**
   - Cron job runs weekly (Monday 9 AM)
   - System queries expiring contracts
   - Email templates generated
   - Notifications sent to users with preferences enabled

### Key Components

#### 1. Authentication System
```typescript
// JWT-based authentication with role-based access
const authenticateToken = async (req, res, next) => {
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'amc-secret-2025');
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: decoded.userId }
  });
  req.user = user;
  next();
};
```

#### 2. Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin**: Full system access
- **Manager**: Department-level access
- **Owner**: Personal contracts only

#### 3. Email Notification System
```javascript
// Automated weekly reminders
cron.schedule("0 9 * * 1", () => {
  checkExpiringContracts();
  checkExpiringPurchaseOrders();
});
```

#### 4. Responsive UI Components
- Card and table view modes
- Mobile-first design approach
- Consistent design system with Tailwind

## Database Design

### Schema Overview
```sql
-- Users table with role-based access
model User {
  id               String       @id @default(cuid())
  name             String
  email            String       @unique
  password         String
  role             String       
  department       String      
  emailPreference  Boolean      @default(true)
  poEmailPreference Boolean     @default(true)
  amcContracts     AmcContract[]
  purchaseOrders   PurchaseOrder[]
}

-- AMC Contracts with asset tracking
model AmcContract {
  id                String     @id @default(cuid())
  amcType           String
  make              String
  model             String
  serialNumber      String
  assetNumber       String     @unique
  warrantyStart     DateTime
  warrantyEnd       DateTime
  amcStart          DateTime
  amcEnd            DateTime
  location          String
  vendor            String
  department        String     
  ownerId           String
  owner             User       @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id])
}

-- Purchase Orders management
model PurchaseOrder {
  id                String     @id @default(cuid())
  vendorCode        String
  vendorName        String
  vendorInfo        String
  poNumber          String     @unique
  poDate            DateTime
  validityStart     DateTime
  validityEnd       DateTime
  department        String     
  ownerId           String
  owner             User       @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id])
}
```

### Key Design Decisions
1. **CUID for IDs** - Collision-resistant unique identifiers
2. **Cascading Deletes** - Maintain referential integrity
3. **Indexed Fields** - Optimized queries on frequently searched fields

  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
  },
});

// Scheduled notifications
const checkExpiringContracts = async () => {
  const expiringSoon = await prisma.amcContract.findMany({
    where: {
      amcEnd: {
        gte: today,
        lte: sixMonthsFromToday,
      },
    },
    include: { owner: true },
  });
  
  // Send personalized emails
  for (const contract of expiringSoon) {

    }
  }
};

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Role-Based Access Control
**Problem**: Different user roles needed different levels of data access across multiple entities.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented middleware-based role checking
- Created reusable permission functions
- Database queries with role-based WHERE clauses

```javascript
// Role-based data filtering
let whereClause = {};
if (req.user.role === 'OWNER') {
  whereClause = { ownerId: req.user.id };
} else if (req.user.role === 'MANAGER') {
  whereClause = { department: req.user.department };
}
// Admins see all data (no where clause)
```

### Challenge 2: Email Delivery Reliability
**Problem**: Email notifications were critical but could fail due to SMTP issues.

**Solution**:
- Implemented retry logic
- Added email logging
- Graceful error handling
- User preference management

### Challenge 3: Date Handling Across Timezones
**Problem**: Contract dates needed consistent handling across different user locations.

**Solution**:
- Standardized on UTC storage
- Client-side timezone conversion
- Consistent date formatting

### Challenge 4: Performance with Large Datasets
**Problem**: Contract listing could become slow with hundreds of records.

**Solution**:
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Pagination implementation
- Optimized database queries
- Client-side filtering for better UX

### Challenge 5: Mobile Responsiveness
**Problem**: Complex data tables didn't work well on mobile devices.

**Solution**:
- Implemented card/table view toggle
- Mobile-optimized layouts
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Progressive disclosure of information
